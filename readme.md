Jinja Madlibs Exercies in Flask

In this repository I practice using Jinja to create a Madlibs Application.

The following is everything I have utilized in this exercise
1. Running Serverside (localhost) Python using Flask
2. I access and modify an html page using Python/Flask
3. I go further and access a CSS file using Flask
4. I have created the general structure using base.html which gets inherted to the index.html and other html files
